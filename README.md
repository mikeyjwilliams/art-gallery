## art-gallery-2

version 2.0.0 of the art gallery project. The first art gallery project, looked like a _success_.
Inside **testing site** it worked just fine, until I got to the **production** site. Then it came to a crash.
So I am coming back to rework a new solution on how to implement a working solution on an art gallery.

lessons: 
 - read the documentation closely
 - try testing in production site early -> even with a small batch of data.
 - test and test often.
 - read the documentation carefully
